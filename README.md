# FTDRAW

## Overview

ftdraw is a test area for using Reportlab to draw relationship (in the broadest sense) diagrams and output them as PDF documents.

Strange to say it but I can no longer remember what the 'ft' in 'ftdraw' stands for so for the moment at least it's ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Virtual Env

This project uses pipenev.
